## Content

 - /data : contains data for synthetic examples (Section VI.D)
 - /demos : contains demo files that produce tables and figures
 - /figures : where the tables and figures are saved
 - /images : contains illustrative figures for this ```README.md```
 - /src : contains helpful files to run the demos

## Minimal requirements

 In order to run the demo file ```demo.m```, you will need to add to your MATLAB path:
 - Tensorlab 3.0: https://www.tensorlab.net
 - Hyperspectral data: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes
      
## Full requirements

 In order to run the demo file ```demos/main.m```, you will need to add to your MATLAB path:
 - Tensorlab 3.0: https://www.tensorlab.net
 - Codes by C. Kanatsoulis: https://github.com/marhar19/HSR_via_tensor_decomposition
 - Codes for HySure: https://github.com/alfaiate/HySure
 - Codes for FUSE: https://github.com/qw245/BlindFuse
 - Hyperspectral data: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes
 
 ## Demo file
 
 A demo with minimal requirements is available. To proceed, please run the ```demo.m``` file.
 
 ### Load hyperspectral data
 
 Start by loading hyperspectral data. This parts manually generates the HSI and MSI from the groundtruth SRI, by computing the degradation matrices.
 Below is an example of a single spectral band for the HSI and MSI from the Indian Pines dataset.

 ### Run algorithms
 
 The next step is to run the algorithms SCOTT and BSCOTT (Blind-SCOTT).
 ```
 R = [40 40 6]; opts.Nblocks = [4 4];
 [SRI_hat1, ~] = scott2(HSI, MSI, P1, P2, Pm, R);
 [SRI_hat2, ~] = bscott(MSI,HSI,Pm,R,opts);
 ```
 The algorithms return the estimated SRI of given multilinear rank <b>R</b>. For BSCOTT, the HSI and MSI are split into corresponding <b>opts.Nblocks</b> blocks along the spatial dimensions.

 ### Comparison metrics
 
 You can then produce a table containing comparison metrics and computation time for the algorithms. In our example, this table becomes:


| Algorithm | R-SNR   | CC       | SAM     | ERGAS   | Time (s) |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| SCOTT     | 26.3908 | 0.887454 | 2.32401 | 1.0587  | 0.26491  |
| BSCOTT    | 18.647  | 0.820201 | 4.27434 | 2.62442 | 0.1644   |


## Reproduce figures and tables from the paper

To do so, you need to run the ```demos/main.m``` file.
Here, a menu is available and allows you to choose which figure or table you want to generate.
Each number in the table below corresponds to a set of figures, and/or tables.

| Number | Content                                        |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | produces Tables I and II and Figures 3 and 4   |
| 2      | produces Tables III and IV and Figures 5 and 6 |
| 3      | produces Table V                               |
| 4      | produces Figures 7 and 8                       |
| 5      | produces Figures 9 and 10                      |
| 6      | produces Figure 11                             |
| 7      | produces Figure 12                             |
| 8      | produces Figures 13 and 14                     |
| 9      | produces Figures 15 and 16                     |
| 10     | produces Figures 17 and 18                     |
| 11     | produces Figures 20, 21 and 22                 |
