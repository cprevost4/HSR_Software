This software reproduces the results from the paper <i>"Hyperspectral Super-Resolution with Coupled Tucker Approximation:
Recoverability and SVD-based algorithms"</i> - C. Prévost, K. Usevich, D. Brie, P. Comon.

 - Hyperspectral data: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes
      
## Full requirements

 In order to run the demo file ```demos/main.m```, you will need to add to your MATLAB path:

 ## Demo file
 
 A demo with minimal requirements is available. To proceed, please run the ```demo.m``` file.
 
 ### Load hyperspectral data
 
 Start by loading hyperspectral data. This parts manually generates the HSI and MSI from the groundtruth SRI, by computing the degradation matrices.
 Below is an example of a single spectral band for the HSI and MSI from the Indian Pines dataset.

 ### Run algorithms
 
 The next step is to run the algorithms SCOTT and BSCOTT (Blind-SCOTT).
 ```
 R = [40 40 6]; opts.Nblocks = [4 4];
 [SRI_hat1, ~] = scott2(HSI, MSI, P1, P2, Pm, R);
 [SRI_hat2, ~] = bscott(MSI,HSI,Pm,R,opts);
 ```
 The algorithms return the estimated SRI of given multilinear rank <b>R</b>. For BSCOTT, the HSI and MSI are split into corresponding <b>opts.Nblocks</b> blocks along the spatial dimensions.
 
 ### Comparison metrics
 
 You can then produce a table containing comparison metrics and computation time for the algorithms. In our example, this table becomes:


| Algorithm | R-SNR   | CC       | SAM     | ERGAS   | Time (s) |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| SCOTT     | 26.3908 | 0.887454 | 2.32401 | 1.0587  | 0.26491  |
| BSCOTT    | 18.647  | 0.820201 | 4.27434 | 2.62442 | 0.1644   |
